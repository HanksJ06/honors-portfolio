		<h3>Year in review 2025</h3>
	</header>
	<p>
		This past year has been full of experiences that have had a significant impact on my personal, academic, and professional goals and the direction of my life overall. One of the most transformative opportunities has been preparing for a six-month work experience in Tokyo, Japan. As a student in the University Honors Program with a dual focus on networking and game design, I saw this as a unique chance to apply my academic knowledge in a real-world, cross-cultural setting. The process of organizing the trip—working closely with three other students, learning how to prepare for life and work abroad, and stepping outside my comfort zone—has helped me build a much stronger sense of independence and adaptability. It has also clarified just how passionate I am about working in international tech environments and building connections through shared innovation.
	</p>
	<p>
		Alongside this major opportunity, my internship experience this year also played a huge role in my growth. I collaborated with another intern to develop a Chrome extension timer that tracked how much time a user spent on GitHub and sent that data to a database we designed ourselves. I was responsible for the backend and database setup, while my partner focused on the timer itself. This project strengthened my technical skills in JavaScript, SQL, and general database management, but even more importantly, it taught me how to communicate clearly with a teammate and present a working product to stakeholders. I left the experience not just with a finished project I’m proud of, but also with the confidence that I can take a leadership role in future tech collaborations. That experience also confirmed that I’m most passionate about roles that allow me to create tools or games that are both functional and engaging.
	</p>
	<p>
		These two experiences—the Tokyo preparation and my IT internship—helped me shape my academic and professional goals for the next year. Academically, I plan to continue building my game development portfolio, improving my coding abilities in Unity and Unreal Engine, and diving deeper into topics like cybersecurity and server infrastructure through my networking coursework. Professionally, I want to pursue a co-op opportunity either in Japan or with a tech company that values both innovation and global collaboration. I also plan to refine my resume and LinkedIn presence, publish at least one small indie game, and become more involved in networking events or student-led tech organizations on campus.
	</p>
	<p>
		Looking ahead, I believe that continuing to surround myself with ambitious, creative peers and seeking out challenges that stretch my comfort zone will be key to furthering this growth. I also plan to lean more on the mentorship and resources available through UHP, such as alumni connections, reflective workshops, and project grants, to help hold myself accountable. I know that growth is not always linear, but with the foundation I’ve built this year and the goals I’ve set, I’m confident I’m moving in a direction that’s not just academically successful but personally fulfilling.
